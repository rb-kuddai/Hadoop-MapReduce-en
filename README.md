# [Extreme Computing (Hadoop/MapReduce)](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/)

## ex1
Different standard [MarReduce tasks](./Homework1_tasks.pdf), such as word counting, simple joins, etc.  (the only notable exception is the one with matrix transposing where we had to use a custom partitioner)

## ex2
[MapReduce tasks](./Homework2_tasks.pdf) for more difficult joins (mostly, on stackoverflow dataset). As an extra small script that allowed to combining my code into the final report (as it was too easy to miss some command).

## Final grade for tasks
92/100
