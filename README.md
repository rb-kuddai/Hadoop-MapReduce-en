# [Extreme Computing (Hadoop/MapReduce)](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/)

## ex1
Different standard MarReduce tasks, such word counting, simple joins, etc.  (the only notable exception is the one with matrix transposing where we had to use custom–µ partitioner)

## ex2
MapReduce tasks for more difficult joins (mostly on stackoverflow dataset). As extra small script that allowed to combine my code into the final report (as it was too easy to miss some command).
